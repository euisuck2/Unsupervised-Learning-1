# Airbnb Data Analysis and Machine Learning Project

This project aims to explore, analyze, and derive insights from Airbnb data through comprehensive data preprocessing and the application of machine learning techniques, including deep learning, supervised learning, and unsupervised learning models.

## Project Overview

The Airbnb Data Analysis and Machine Learning Project is structured into four main components, each represented by a Jupyter notebook:

1. **Airbnb Data Base Preprocessing (Final)**: This notebook covers the initial data preprocessing steps required to clean and prepare the Airbnb dataset for analysis and modeling.

2. **Deep Learning**: Here, we delve into deep learning models to predict outcomes based on the preprocessed data.

3. **Supervised Learning**: This notebook applies various supervised learning techniques to the Airbnb data to predict or classify outcomes.

4. **Unsupervised Learning**: Focuses on clustering and other unsupervised learning methods to uncover patterns and insights from the data.

## Installation

To run this project, you'll need to have Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab installed. If you haven't installed it yet, follow the instructions on the [Jupyter website](https://jupyter.org/install).

You'll also need Python 3.x and the following libraries:

- NumPy
- Pandas
